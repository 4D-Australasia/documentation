</summary><p></p>



Welcome to the first video in the Dashnetics Video Tutorial Series.

For the best experience, we recommend you follow along with these Tutorials 

as you work on your own dashnetics server, pausing the video whenever you need to.

In this first video we will unbox a blank Dashnetics Application and add our first page.

After receiving a link and login details from your dashnetics team

The first thing to note is that Dashnetics is made up of two sites,  

your public facing site which will start out blank

and a password protected administration site which you will use to build your front facing site.

the difference between the two is an admin dot at the front of the admin site.

Once we've logged in to the admin site we can begin building our web application, 

Lets create our first page. 

The first option under the menu  is "Page Settings"

The button under Page Settings is "Add"

Lets give it a name e.g. "Home Page" and a URI e.g. "home"

Its our only page, so let's tick the "default" option which will make it our users' landing page.

Once we save, we can refresh our public facing site and see it has redirected us to our first page, which is blank.
