Custom codes can also be added to a page by adding an HTML Text Area.
This can be useful for designers/developers who want to take control of each and every element present in the DOM.

Let's start by adding a simple HTML Text Area in a page.

1. Go to the Admin Module
1. Select the Admin Module Menu
1. Select 'Page Management'
1. Select 'Setup Pages'
1. Select the Form Control Icon

![img](//img/testpage.png)

6. Select "Add" to add a form control.
7. Enter a Name - For example, "html section"
8. Select the Type dropdown and choose "HTML Text Area"
9. Width can remain as "0" to show the default width. This can be changed later if necessary
10. Within the HTML Text area, add any html code that you want to display on that page.
11. Check the box "Divider After". This will ensure the next element we add will appear below the heading.
    ![img](//img/addHTML-1.png)
12. Select "Save"

You'll see the output as follows:
![img](//img/addHTML-1-output.png)

Our next step is to add some CSS for styling.
