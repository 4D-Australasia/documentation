# Installation


Dashnetics is a cloud-based product.

There is **nothing to install** in relation to the Software.

You should receive an email with a link to your server url e.g. https://demo.dashnetics.com.au.

The ADMIN server is reached simply by adding "admin." before the server url e.g. https://admin.demo.dashnetics.com.au

You will have to set a user and password to sign in to your admin for the first time.

Once you have signed in, you can access the admin function directly from this link.

Once you choose a default landing page for your site, the original address will point directly to this page. e.g. https://demo.dashnetics.com.au/home
