6.  Select 'Add' to add a new form control
7.  Select the type as Menu bar, give a name to the section
8.  At the bottom, select the menu that we created
9.  In the settings input fields, we can add as many CSS properties as we want to as shown in the example

10.  In this way, we can add CSS to style the menu and now the result is as follows:

All menus created using Dashnetics are completely responsive and works absolutely fine on small screen devices.

The position of the menu can also be adjusted by re-ordering the fields on the page. For example, you might prefer the page to display a banner at the top of the page and the menu below the banner.
