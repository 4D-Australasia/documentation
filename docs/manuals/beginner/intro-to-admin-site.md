Here you will discover how to Sign in to your admin site, to be partnered with our <h2><i className="material-icons-h2">videocam</i> [Signing In Tutorial Video](/vids/Dashnetics-SigningIn.mp4)</h2>.

## Installation

Dashnetics is a cloud-based product.

There is **nothing to install** in relation to the Software.

All work is done online, anytime, from any device and is saved and backed up to your Dashnetics Cloud.


## Getting There

> Prerequisites: a "Set Password" email [click to have it resent](mailto:help@dashnetics.com.au?subject=send_user_setup_email)


You should have received an email with a set password link.

This link will take you to your admin site where you can add yourself as a password protected administrative user.

Your Admin site address is the same as your public facing application address with an [ **admin.** ] before the address.

For Example:


|Administrative Address | [https://admin.demo.dashnetics.com.au/](https://admin.demo.dashnetics.com.au/) |  
| ----------------------|-------------------------- |
| Public Facing Application | [https://demo.dashnetics.com.au/](https://demo.dashnetics.com.au/) |


## Getting Around
