Click here to see the Xero support page for instructions.

To export customer contacts from Xero, refer to the Xero instructions above. Please note the steps below.

1.  Sign into Xero.
2.  Click **Contacts** > **Customers**.
3.  Ensure the **Customers** tab is selected and click **Export**. A file called 'Contacts.csv' is downloaded.
4.  Rename the file to **Customers.csv**.
5.  Repeat this process for suppliers, but in Step 2, select **Contacts** > **Suppliers**.
    
6.  If you have any contractors, you can export those too, by selecting **Contacts** > **Contractors**.

Identify your contacts as 'Client' or 'Supplier'

If you have exported all of your contacts to one file, you will need to add a column called 'Client/Supplier' and use it to identify each contact as either a Client or a Supplier. This will ensure that we import your contacts correctly into Dashnetics; if no distinction is made, all your contacts will be imported as Clients.

</summary>

Use the following to learn how to export customer information from QuickBooks Online to Excel. 

## Export customer data to Excel 

There are two ways to export your customer information to Excel. 

The first is from the Customers page, and the other is from the Reports page. 

Each method will result in a different result, and will affect the information you can export to Excel.
 
### Export customer data from the Customers page 

If you export from the Customer page, you'll be able to export information like Name, Company, Address, Phone number, Email Address, Customer type, Attachment, Currency, Balance, and Notes. 

From the left menu, select Sales, then Customers. 

Select the Export icon next to the Print icon. 

Choose Export to Excel. 

### Export customer data from the Reports page 

If you export from the Reports page, you can customise the customer information you want to export to Excel. 

This is more advantageous if you're looking for something more specific or want the capability to customise information. 

From the left menu, select Reports. 

Go to Sales and Customers section. 

Select Customer Contact List. 

Note: You can modify this report by selecting the three vertical dots (?) icon, then Customise. 

Under Rows/Columns drop-down, select Change columns. 

Add your desired columns, then select Run report. (Optional) 

If you have plans to run this exact same report some other time, select Save customisation at the upper right. 

Select the Export icon next to the Print icon, then choose Export to Excel.

## Data from Other Sources

</summary>
 

### 

If you need to export client and supplier data from another source, export your data as a .CSV or .XLS file from that application.

Use our templates

You can use [our templates](import-templates) to prepare your data for uploading via Dashnetics's [bulk import](bulk-data-import) tool.

If your data is complex, use our [import templates](import-templates) and send it to us.  

We recommend that you only include active clients and suppliers. This will ensure users have current client and supplier information from the start.

  

 What information do I need to export?

The client and supplier fields listed below can be imported into Dashnetics.  

*   Any headings in your file do not have to match the field name we have in Dashnetics. (E.g. Your file may have 'given name' and Dashnetics has 'first name')
