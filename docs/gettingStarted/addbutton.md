We now have a page with two input fields. Data can be entered in these fields but the form does not save yet. To do this we use a button. 

Buttons can be added to a page to handle navigation, resetting a form, send emails or simply save the data. A page can have multiple buttons and a button can have multiple actions.

We will add a button to save data entered on our form.

1. Go to the Admin Module
1. Select the Admin Module Menu
1. Select 'Page Management'
1. Select 'Setup Pages'
1. Select the Form Control Icon

6. Select 'Add' to add a form control.
1. Enter a Name - For example, "save button"
1. Select the Type dropdown and choose "Button"
1. Width can remain as "0" to show the default width. This can be changed later if necessary
1. Add a Placeholder/Label which will appear as text on the button - For example, "Submit"

We can now review our page and we will see our new button.

Our next step is to add an action to our button.
