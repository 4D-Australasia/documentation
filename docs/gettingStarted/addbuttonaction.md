We now have a page with two input fields and a button. Data can be entered in these fields but the form does not save yet becuase we haven't added an action to the button.

We will add an action to our button.

1. Go to the Admin Module
1. Select the Admin Module Menu
1. Select 'Page Management'
1. Select 'Setup Pages'
1. Select the Form Actions icon
