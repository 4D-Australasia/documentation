6. Select 'Add' to add a form control.
1. Enter a Name - For example, "first name"

1. Select "Save"
1. Repeat the steps to add a second Input field called "last name"
1. With this second field we will check the box "Divider After" as we want anything added to the page after the second field to show on a new line.

We have just added two input fields onto our form. We can view the page using https://yourdomain/test. It should appear as:

On a mobile device Project CX will automatically control the positioning of the fields to suit.
